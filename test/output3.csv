2,"Letter from   the  President Dear Valued Customer, 2024 is underway with an exciting year ahead full of innovation, advancements in sustainability,  and our continued journey of growth as a multi material surface provider. While we focus on bringing you exciting new surfaces and designs to meet the ever-changing  needs and tastes of the market, the health and wellbeing of our partners continues to be our  top priority. I’m pleased to announce that almost 5,000 fabricators worldwide have successfully  completed our Masters of Stone program. We continue to make this program available in over  12 languages to ensure all those in our industry can easily access education that fosters a healthy  and safe work environment. At KBIS 2024 in Las Vegas, we debuted our new Quartz Ooak Collection—a portfolio of stunning  designs that take veining to the next level. With marble inspiration, the Ooak Collection  combines rich and complex patterns with depth of color for designs that are statement-making  but still with our classic Caesarstone sophistication and timelessness. Additionally, as we continue to expand our Porcelain offering in North America, we’re also  pleased to bring you seven new Porcelain colors inspired by rich limestones, marble, and  quartzite. As we see the demand for Porcelain continue to grow, we’ll have more exciting  announcements to share about our offering throughout the year. If you’re in the Charlotte, NC area, stop by our newly launched design center—an inspirational  place to work, meet clients, and see our full collection of Quartz and Porcelain on display. As  we continue our expansion plans, look for more new design centres opening across the United  States later this year. We’re also excited to launch our new trend report Beyond the Surface—a collaboration with  industry tastemakers from across North America—bringing design pros and enthusiasts thought- provoking ideas and inspiration for their next project. Beyond the Surface can be found  here . We’re energized for the year to come and look forward to your partnership as we brace for an  exciting year of evolution in surfaces. Sincerely,     Erik Christensen   President of Caesarstone US   2 Caesarstone","","","","","","","","","","","",""

15,"Rough With a complex and  robust look and feel,   it intensifies the depth   of the colors. An  advanced technology  that achieves the effect  of coarse industrial  materials, but remains  smooth for easy cleaning. Concrete Stone A low light reflection  and a slightly textured  appearance evokes the  sensation of an organic  material. Tenderly tactile with a pleasant  radiance, this finish has the  soothing touch of a semi-smooth  stone. Its appearance is that of a  weathered rock, which comforts  in a genuinely authentic way. Natural Silk A slightly textured satin  sheen conjures up the  warm and grainy touch  of stone. This finish covers the surface in  a shimmering overlay. The light  glides softly over the stone,  creating a luxurious appeal that  adds a dimension of softness  and comfort. Honed Honed Smooth to the touch and  gentle on the eye, this  finish adds a delicate  sophistication to the  surface. Our Honed finish is smooth  to the touch and soft on the  eye, offering a special organic  luminosity. Its satin sheen  reflects light, while retaining  a special shine that penetrates  the surface to highlight deeper  dimensions. Polished Ultra Rough High-gloss smoothness  attracts light and  illuminates with a natural  glow. Inspired by the tactility of  rough stone, industrial metals  and concrete, this finish  reinforces the organic nuances  of the stone.
